	 * 0 - not crouching
	 * 1 - shrinking, and on the ground
	 * 2 - currently crouched, idle
	 * 3 - growing, and on ground
	 * 4 - shrinking and in air
	 * 5 - currently crouched, idle
	 * 6 - growing, and in air
	 * the difference between 1 and 4, and 3 and 6 is that when crouchng on the groud we lower our head and keep the feet in the same spot, while in the air we do the opposite, we raise our feet and keep our head int he same spot
	 * 
	 * jump:
	 * 0-not jumping
	 * 1 - just jumped, adding velocity and changing gravity to upGrav
	 * 2 - in stage 1 of the jump, waiting for velocity to go to zero before going to state 3
	 * 3 - reached the second stage of the jump, already set the gravity to downGrav, waiting to touch the ground. when we do, we sert the gravity to standardGrav, and go to state 0
	 * if at anypoint duriong these states, the spacebar is released, gravity is set to standard, and state is set to 0
